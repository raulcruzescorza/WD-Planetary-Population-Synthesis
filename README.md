# WD-Planetary-Population-Synthesis
A population synthesis simulation to model the surviving population of rocky planets around white dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood. This code generates a time-evolving population of planetary systems based on Madau &amp; Dickinson SFH, Chabrier IMF, occurrence rates from Hsu et al. (2019), and stellar evolution based on Sanderson et al. (2022).
